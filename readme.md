# The read me file generator

## Description

The reason I built this project was to understand how to use npm to install third party libraries, how to use node to run a JavaScript file, and how to create and write information to a markdown file. This project allows you to generate a readme.md file for one of your projects, by entering its information into the read me file generator. Besides generating a readme.md file, this project will also generate a badge with the name of the license your project uses, and, in the license section of the readme.md file, it will place a link to a website where you can obtain more information about your project's license.
